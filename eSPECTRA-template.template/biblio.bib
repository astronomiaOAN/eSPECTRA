	abstract = {Spacecraft observations around Mars show that ionospheric irregularities occur frequently in the Martian ionosphere. In this study, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution data (the region is below ∼200 km) from 2015 January to 2021 March were used to revisit the statistical characteristics of ionospheric irregularities and the comparison of irregularities in Martian years with higher or lower solar activity phase of the solar cycle. Results show that the characteristics of the irregularities with a larger length scale associated with the magnetic field and solar zenith angle are similar to the previous studies. Moreover, our results show that the occurrence rate of irregularities exhibits dawn and dusk asymmetry, and the occurrence rate at dusk is higher than that at dawn. In addition, results demonstrate that the occurrence rate of irregularities is higher in Martian years with higher solar activity than in Martian years with lower solar activity, which means that the solar cycle might play an important role in the formation of irregularity events. Further studies show that the solar zenith angle (SZA) and altitude at the maximum occurrence rate depend on the level of solar activity. The SZA and altitude of the maximum occurrence rate are smaller in the Martian year with higher solar activity than the lower. We also found that the rate of events is lower during the day than at the terminator in the ionospheric dynamo region. By contrast, in the regions where both electrons and ions are magnetized, events have a higher rate during the day than in the terminator. Furthermore, the seasonal variation of the irregular events was also presented in this study. Results show that the occurrence rate in the dynamo region with 80° < SZA < 150° in MY34 and MY35 shows an incremental trend from spring to winter, but this trend is not obvious in MY33.}

The Martian atmosphere is mainly CO2 with a mean surface pressure of 6.1 mb. Its thermal structure, wind systems, and photochemistry are similar to Earth's but with important differences. The present climate is characterized in terms of the seasonal cycles of dust, water, and CO2. Past climates were different due to large changes in Mars' orbital characteristics, and a thicker atmosphere that existed very early in its history. Liquid water flowed on the surface at these early times, but is not stable on Mars today.}

To facilitate assessment of instrument performance and validation of results obtained on Mars, SAM houses a calibration cell containing CO2, Ar, N2, Xe, and several fluorinated hydrocarbon compounds (Franz et al., 2014; Mahaffy et al., 2012). This report describes the first two experiments utilizing this calibration cell on Mars and gives results from analysis of data acquired with the SAM Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS). These data support the accuracy of isotope ratios obtained with the QMS (Conrad et al., 2016; Mahaffy et al., 2013) and provide ground-truth for reassessment of analytical constants required for atmospheric measurements, which were reported in previous contributions (Franz et al., 2015, 2014). The most significant implication of the QMS data involves reinterpretation of pre-launch contamination previously believed to affect only CO abundance measurements (Franz et al., 2015) to affect N2 abundances, as well. The corresponding adjustment to the N2 calibration constant presented here brings the atmospheric volume mixing ratios for Ar and N2 retrieved by SAM into closer agreement with those reported by the Viking mission (Owen et al., 1977; Oyama and Berdahl, 1977).}

We then discuss the new results obtained from the two latest missions, namely, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and Mars Express (MEX). The MGS had three ionospheric and atmospheric related experiments, namely, (1) the radio science experiment, which generated 5600 electron density profiles covering a major portion of sunspot cycle 23; (2) the magnetometer/electron reflectometer experiment, which very clearly answered the question about the presence or absence of Martian intrinsic magnetic field; and (3) the accelerometer experiment, which provided a large database of atmospheric density at various Martian locations during the aerobraking phases. The topside sounder on the MEX provided electron density profiles for altitudes above the primary ionospheric peak with a very high time resolution, thereby providing opportunity for exploring ionospheric conditions during events of rapid changes like solar flares. Unlike Venus, where simultaneous electron density, ion density, and magnetic field measurements were made, Mars lacks this kind of information. Consequently, most of our current understanding of Mars' plasma environment is based on theoretical models. We therefore review the various atmospheric and ionospheric models for Mars, which have been generated during the last 4 decades.},

abstract = {The Mariner 9 S-band radio occultation measurements, which were taken over half a Martian year, were examined for seasonal variations in atmospheric pressures and temperatures. Seasonally related atmospheric pressure oscillations on a global scale were discovered when the pressures were compared on equi-potential levels. There was a global increase in pressure of about 13\% between northern winter and spring seasons, and a global decrease in pressure of nearly 14\% between northern spring and summer seasons. The maximum global pressure occurred during the northern spring season approximately one Martian month prior to aphelion. These pressure oscillations were correlated with the seasonal growth and decay, and the total area of the polar caps. Temperatures in the mid-latitude regions near the subsolar points were highest during the northern winter season when Mars was closest to the sun. In addition, high latitudinal temperature gradients (up to 2°K per degree latitude) were found. This has important atmospheric dynamical implications, especially for the growth of baroclinic waves. Occultation observations also indicated that the average elevation of the southern hemisphere was nearly 4km higher than the northern hemisphere when referenced to an equipotential level. The occultation measurements showed that the atmospheric pressures near the surface in the southern hemisphere were 33 to 43\% lower than the atmospheric pressures near the surface in the northern hemisphere. In addition to other parameters, the asymmetry in the density of the Martian atmosphere and the hemispheric altitude differences are important in understanding the seasonal dynamic processes that exist in the polar cap regions and in the Martian atmosphere generally.}}

abstract = {The new NRLMSISE-00 empirical atmospheric model extends from the ground to the exobase and is a major upgrade of the MSISE-90 model in the thermosphere. The new model and the associated NRLMSIS database now include the following data: (1) total mass density from satellite accelerometers and from orbit determination (including the Jacchia and Barlier data sets), (2) temperature from incoherent scatter radar covering 1981–1997, and (3) molecular oxygen number density, [O2], from solar ultraviolet occultation aboard the Solar Maximum Mission. A new component, “anomalous oxygen,” allows for appreciable O+ and hot atomic oxygen contributions to the total mass density at high altitudes and applies primarily to drag estimation above 500 km. Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-00, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia-70 over a wide range of F10.7. Considering the two regimes together, NRLMSISE-00 achieves an improvement over both MSISE-90 and Jacchia-70 by incorporating advantages of each.},

abstract = {Abstract NRLMSIS® 2.0 is an empirical atmospheric model that extends from the ground to the exobase and describes the average observed behavior of temperature, eight species densities, and mass density via a parametric analytic formulation. The model inputs are location, day of year, time of day, solar activity, and geomagnetic activity. NRLMSIS 2.0 is a major, reformulated upgrade of the previous version, NRLMSISE-00. The model now couples thermospheric species densities to the entire column, via an effective mass profile that transitions each species from the fully mixed region below ~70 km altitude to the diffusively separated region above ~200 km. Other changes include the extension of atomic oxygen down to 50 km and the use of geopotential height as the internal vertical coordinate. We assimilated extensive new lower and middle atmosphere temperature, O, and H data, along with global average thermospheric mass density derived from satellite orbits, and we validated the model against independent samples of these data. In the mesosphere and below, residual biases and standard deviations are considerably lower than NRLMSISE-00. The new model is warmer in the upper troposphere and cooler in the stratosphere and mesosphere. In the thermosphere, N2 and O densities are lower in NRLMSIS 2.0; otherwise, the NRLMSISE-00 thermosphere is largely retained. Future advances in thermospheric specification will likely require new in situ mass spectrometer measurements, new techniques for species density measurement between 100 and 200 km, and the reconciliation of systematic biases among thermospheric temperature and composition data sets, including biases attributable to long-term changes.},

abstract = {The planetary boundary layer (PBL) represents the part of the atmosphere that is strongly influenced by the presence of the underlying surface and mediates the key interactions between the atmosphere and the surface. On Mars, this represents the lowest 10 km of the atmosphere during the daytime. This portion of the atmosphere is extremely important, both scientifically and operationally, because it is the region within which surface lander spacecraft must operate and also determines exchanges of heat, momentum, dust, water, and other tracers between surface and subsurface reservoirs and the free atmosphere. To date, this region of the atmosphere has been studied directly, by instrumented lander spacecraft, and from orbital remote sensing, though not to the extent that is necessary to fully constrain its character and behavior. Current data strongly suggest that as for the Earth's PBL, classical Monin-Obukhov similarity theory applies reasonably well to the Martian PBL under most conditions, though with some intriguing differences relating to the lower atmospheric density at the Martian surface and the likely greater role of direct radiative heating of the atmosphere within the PBL itself. Most of the modeling techniques used for the PBL on Earth are also being applied to the Martian PBL, including novel uses of very high resolution large eddy simulation methods. We conclude with those aspects of the PBL that require new measurements in order to constrain models and discuss the extent to which anticipated missions to Mars in the near future will fulfill these requirements.},

In this study, we present the first multi-annual survey of water vapor profile covering the altitude range from 0 to 100 km based on the SPICAM/Mars Express occultation measurements. During the aphelion season, water remains confined below 40–60 km for all Martian years observed. The highest altitude where water vapor can be spotted is between 70 and 90 km during the southern summer (Ls = 240–300°; perihelion season), approaching the transition between the middle and upper atmosphere. In this season, years without a global dust storm (GDS) show a significant moistening of the upper atmosphere (∼100 ppmv) in the southern hemisphere, confirming a seasonal impact on the hydrogen escape rate. The two observed GDS, in MY28 and MY34, show a substantial disparity in water vapor response. The storm in MY28, which coincides with the southern summer solstice, creates the largest excess of water in both hemispheres at >80 km. This climatology of water vapor will supply a robust statistical basis to address the long-term escape processes of water from Mars.},

We report results from 24 orbits obtained during MY28 at Ls 130°–160°, and the latitude range of 40°–55° N. For these orbits the atmospheric density from 1.43 μm CO2 band, water vapor mixing ratio based on 1.38 μm absorption, and aerosol opacities were retrieved simultaneously. The vertical resolution of measurements is better than 3.5 km. Aerosol vertical extinction profiles were obtained at 10 wavelengths in the altitude range from 10 to 60 km. The interpretation using Mie scattering theory with adopted refraction indices of dust and H2O ice allows to retrieve particle size (reff∼0.5–1 μm) and number density (∼1 cm−3 at 15–30 km) profiles. The haze top is generally below 40 km, except the longitude range of 320°–50° E, where high-altitude clouds at 50–60 km were detected. Optical properties of these clouds are compatible with ice particles (effective radius reff=0.1–0.3 μm, number density N∼10 cm−3) distributed with variance νeff=0.1–0.2 μm. The vertical optical depth of the clouds is below 0.001 at 1 μm. The atmospheric density profiles are retrieved from CO2 band in the altitude range of 10–90 km, and H2O mixing ratio is determined at 15–50 km. Unless a supersaturation of the water vapor occurs in the martian atmosphere, the H2O mixing ratio indicates ∼5 K warmer atmosphere at 25–45 km than predicted by models.}

abstract = {Observations made by the SPICAM ultraviolet spectrometer on board the Mars Express orbiter are presented. We focus on several hundreds of atmospheric profiles which have been collected over 3/4 of a Martian year by making use of the stellar occultation technique. The typical structure of the Martian haze possesses at least one discrete layer (60\% of all cases) standing over an extended portion wherein opacity continuously increases down to the surface. Differences in morphology are, however, noted between profiles observed near the equator and profiles collected elsewhere. The Martian haze exhibits a pronounced seasonal signal manifested by variations in the maximum elevation at which particles are observed. For reasons related to both convective activity and changes in the hygropause level, cold regions display a much lower hazetop than warm regions. Using UV spectrometry data, we put constraints on haze microphysical properties. Vertical variations of particle size are keyed to variations of opacity; e.g., an increase in particle size is systematically observed near extinction peaks. This is the likely consequence of cloud formation which results in a local increase of particle cross-section. Despite marked differences in aerosol profiles between low and high latitudes, haze properties above 60 km remain invariant, possibly reflecting the long-term presence of a background submicronic particle population. Several profiles have been analyzed in more detail to extract properties of detached cloud layers lofted above 40 km. Their optical depth ranges between 0.01 and 0.1 in the visible. Estimation of cloud particle size is technically restricted because of SPICAM wavelength sampling, but it generally yields a minimum radius value of about 0.3 μm, while several estimates are consistent with a robust 0.1–0.2 μm. This crystal size, significantly smaller than the 1 to 4 μm associated with recently classified type I and II clouds, suggests that a different class of clouds, henceforth type III clouds, can be extracted from our data. Observations made in the southern winter polar night indicate a very distinct aerosol behavior where particles are less abundant (τ < 0.1), confined to lower heights (vertical profile consistent with a Conrath parameter exceeding 0.04) and made of particles having a radius on the order of 0.1 μm. This shows that the Martian polar night is a region with a very clean atmosphere and with a distinct type of aerosols.},
